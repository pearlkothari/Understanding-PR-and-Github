### This repository is to teach you about how to start making contributions to the Open-source by making a PR.

First, let's understand what is Git and Github.

Git is a version control system. In Laymen terms, git is tool that is used to track changes in files (a process called version control).

- Git is used to manage various open-source development projects.
- GitHub allows you to store files in the cloud to access them from any computer and to share them with others.

Now what is a Pull Request (or a PR)?
A pull request (referred to as a PR) is a way for you to suggest changes to a repository that are visible and can be easily reviewed.

Now, how to make a PR?
1. Create a fork( a copy of other usersâ€™ files on github.com) of this repository.
- To fork a repository, click the Fork button at the top right in the repository. 
2. Clone that fork to your local computer( copy files from github.com to your computer) and begin to work on COntributing.md file in a text editor.
- To clone, click the code button, take a copy of the link provided, then watch as GitHub takes this repository and adds it as a copy to your account.
3. When you are done editing the text file locally on your computer, you save the file and 'git add' and 'git commit' your changes using git.
4. Finally, you 'git push' those changes back up to your fork of this repository.
